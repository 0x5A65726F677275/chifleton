# Security

## Responsible disclosure

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this scanner (e.g., in how it handles input, runs subprocesses, or writes files), we encourage **responsible disclosure**.

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. **Report the issue** using one of the following:
   - **Preferred:** Open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/reporting-a-vulnerability-in-a-repository) for this repository. Go to the repository **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.
   - **Alternatively:** Contact the maintainer listed in the repository [README](README.md) (Author / attribution section) or in [ASSESSMENT.md](ASSESSMENT.md) (Authorship / attribution). If the repository is under an organization, you may use the organization’s designated security contact if published.
3. Include a description of the issue and steps to reproduce.
4. We will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond within a reasonable time. We may ask for clarification or additional details.
5. We will work on a fix and coordinate with you on disclosure timing (e.g., after a release that includes the fix).

## Vulnerability reporting

- **Scope:** Chifleton itself (parsing, caching, reporting, CLI), not the OSV.dev service or third-party data.
- **Maintainer:** **Jaeha Yoo.** See the repository root [ASSESSMENT.md](../ASSESSMENT.md) for author attribution and contact. Use the repository owner or published security contact when applicable.

Thank you for helping keep this project safe for its users.
